## Other Methods

There are wireless methods of getting your device's UDID, but they involve temporarily installing a profile on your device that sends the device's information to a server to display to you on a webpage. I personal;ly wouldn't utilize any such service, so I won't provide any guide to doing to. You can easily find such a guide online if you truly need it.
